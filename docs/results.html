<h1>Results and Discussion</h1>
<p>The response rates and their overall composition were compared for the six academic years under investigation. Responses to seven of the more quantitative questions (numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 21, 22, and 23) were also examined. In general, student satisfaction is fairly constant or slightly improving. A more complete examination of each comparision is provided below.</p>
<div id="responses" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Response rate by year</h2>
<p>Student response rates for the graduation survey have generally been sufficient over the past six years to allow generalizations to be drawn for the entire population of Ferris graduates. Figure <a href="results.html#fig:responses">1</a> shows the total number of alumni responses collected each academic year. The fewest responses, 524, were collected in 2010/2011 (17% response rate). There has been a steady improvement in response rate since that time. The overall average response rate was 829 per year for the interval investigated (approximately a 25% overall return rate).</p>
