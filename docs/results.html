<h1>Results and Discussion</h1>
<p>The response rates and their overall composition were compared for the six academic years under investigation. Responses to seven of the more quantitative questions (numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 21, 22, and 23) were also examined. In general, student satisfaction is fairly consistent, if perhaps a bit low. A more complete examination of each comparision is provided below.</p>
<div id="responses" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Response rate by year</h2>
<p>Student response rates for the graduation survey have generally been sufficient over the past six years to allow generalizations to be drawn for the entire population of Ferris graduates. Figure <a href="results.html#fig:responses">1</a> shows the total number of alumni responses collected each academic year. The fewest responses, 524, were collected in 2010/2011 (17% response rate). There has been a steady improvement in response rate since that time. The overall average response rate was 829 per year for the interval investigated (approximately a 25% overall return rate). Samples of this size ought to give estimates with a margin or error between two and four percent.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
<p>
Is a response rate of under 30% adequate? What should our target reponse rate be for this instrument? What can be done differently to increase our response rate further?
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="degrees" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Response rate by degree earned</h2>
<p>In order to reliably generalize the findings of these surveys, the demographics of the survey population should also be similar to that of the overall student body at Ferris State University. Therefore, the percent of respondants by credential earned were compared to the percent of actual credentials earned for each year under study, Figure <a href="results.html#fig:factbookDegrees">2</a> shows the actual distribution of credentials awarded by Ferris for each of the past six years.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2: Distribution of credentials awarded by Ferris per academic year
</p>
</div>
<p>In comparison, Figure <a href="results.html#fig:degrees">3</a> illustrates the distribution of credentials earned by the survey respondants. It is readily apparent that Bachelors and Graduate (Masters, Doctoral, and Professional) degrees are over-represented in the survey population. On the other hand, Associates degrees and certificates are under-represented. This reporting bias should be kept in mind while interpreting the survey responses that follow.</p>

<div class="question">
<p>
Do you think that the bias for Bachelor and Graduate degrees is problematic? What steps can we take to ensure better reporting from students in Associates degrees and certificate programs?
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="colleges" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Response rate by college</h2>
<p>Another potential bias could be in the balance of students from various academic colleges. If one or more colleges predominate the survey population, they could skew the results and make interpretation more difficult. The actual distribution of graduates by academic college are shown in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:factbookColleges">4</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 4: Distribution of graduates by academic college per academic year
</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="results.html#fig:colleges">5</a>, in contrast, demonstrates the distribution of survey respondants by academic college. The first thing that is apparent is that Kendall College of Art and Design (KCAD) was not included in the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 datasets. The colleges of Business and Health Professions are slightly over-represented. KCAD, on the other hand, remains somewhat under-represented. The overall proportions are reasonably similar and stable over time. Given these facts, the last four years of data are probably representative enough to make some valid generalizations.</p>

<div id="Q1" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Overall satisfaction ratings</h2>
<p>The overall satisfaction of survey respondants was obtained by from item 1 of the survey: <em>I am satisfied with the quality of education that I recieved at Ferris State University/Kendall College of Art and Design</em>. The mean number of positive responses over the past four years was 92.55%. The trends for responses to this item are shown in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:question1">6</a>. The ratio of respondants that âstrongly agreeâ to âsomewhat agreeâ was 1.62:1. These results seem to represent a fairly high level of overall satisfaction among our responding graduates.</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="Q2" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Preparation for employment</h2>
<p>Item two on the survey was <em>Ferris State University/Kendall College of Art and Design prepared me well for employment.</em> The graduate responses are illustrated in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:question2">7</a>. For this item, the ratio of respondants that âstrongly agreeâ to âsomewhat agreeâ was 1.07:1. The overall number of positive responses over the past four years was 86.08%. These results are somewhat lower than those for item one, but are fairly stable over time.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="Q3" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Preparation for continuing education</h2>
<p>The third item of the survey was <em>Ferris State University/Kendall College of Art and Design prepared me well for continuing my education.</em> The graduate responses are illustrated in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:question3">8</a>. For this item, the ratio of respondants that âstrongly agreeâ to âsomewhat agreeâ was 1.04:1. The overall number of positive responses over the past four years was 86.8%. These results are nearly the same as those of item two. Given that Graduate and Bachelors degree recipients are over-represented in our sample, these numbers are perhaps a bit low.</p>

<div id="Q4" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Good value for the money</h2>
<p>The cost of higher education has continued to increase over the past decade. It is interesting to see if this increase has impacted studentsâ perceptions regarding the value that they get for their money. Item four on the survey was <em>Ferris State University/Kendall College of Art and Design was a good value for my money.</em> The graduate responses are illustrated in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:question4">9</a>. For this item, the ratio of respondants that âstrongly agreeâ to âsomewhat agreeâ was 0.93:1. The overall number of positive responses over the past four years was 80.12%.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
<p>
One out of five graduates does not feel that they got a good value for their money from FSU/Kendall. While it is not surprising that this value is lower, what can we do to increase the value that students perceive from their education at FSU/KCAD?
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="Q21" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Recommendation of Ferris/KCAD</h2>
<p>Our graduates are probably the best advertisement that we have for our institution. Item twenty-one addresses this and it phrase as <em>Since graduating, how often have you recommended FSU/KCAD to prospective students?</em> The graduate responses are illustrated in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:question21">10</a>. For this item, the ratio of respondants that recommended Ferris âoftenâ to âa few timesâ was only 0.55:1. The overall number of positive responses over the past four years was 50.05%. This is by far the lowest score for all the items on the survey.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 10: Since graduating, how often have you recommended FSU/KCAD to prospective students?
</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
<p>
Only half of all respondants indicated that they recommended FSU/KCAD to others very often. What do you think accounts for the apparent discrepancy between satisfaction and recommendation? What can we do to encourage our graduates to recommend FSU/KCAD more in the future?
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="Q22" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Would choose FSU/KCAD again</h2>
<p>Item twenty-two also indicates satisfaction with Ferris State University and/or Kendall College of Art and Design overall. It was worded as <em>If I had the opportunity to start college over, I would still choose to attend Ferris State University/Kendall College of Art and Design.</em> The graduate responses are illustrated in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:question22">11</a>. For this item, the ratio of respondants that âstrongly agreeâ to âsomewhat agreeâ was 1.41:1. The overall number of positive responses over the past four years was 79.6%.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:question22"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 11: If I had the opportunity to start college over, I would still choose to attend FSU/KCAD.
</p>
</div>
<p>A very similar item also appears in the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). It was worded as <em>If you could start over again, would you go to the same institution you are now attending?</em> The responses for freshmen and seniors taking the NSSE are illustrated in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:NSSE">12</a>. These NSSE scores are similar to those of the graduate surveys, but seem to have a more negative trend over time.</p>

</div>
<div class="question">
<p>
One out of five graduates state that they would not attend FSU/KCAD if they had it all to do over again. The NSSE results are even a bit worse. How can we identify and address the factors that contribute to this dissatisfaction?
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="Q23" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Would choose the same program again</h2>
<p>Many students come to Ferris specifically for a particular program. As a result, these students often have more affinity for their program than they do to the overall institution. The last item evaluated (item twenty-three) addresses this as <em>If I had the opportunity to start college over, I would still choose the same program of study.</em> The graduate responses are illustrated in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:question22">11</a>. For this item, the ratio of respondants that âstrongly agreeâ to âsomewhat agreeâ was 2.11:1. The overall number of positive responses over the past four years was 77.88%. The overall score for programs is actually <em>lower</em> than for the entire instituation (by a little). The ratio of âstrongly agreeâ to âsomewhat agreeâ, though, is much higher.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:question23"></span>

Figure 13: If I had the opportunity to start college over, I would still choose the same program of study.
</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
<p>
Despite our strong academic programs, one out of five graduates would not consider choosing their program again. What can we do to identify the causes of this dissatisfaction? There is most likely a correlation between items 22 and 23. Do you think that one impacts the other? If so, in which direction does that causal link fall?
