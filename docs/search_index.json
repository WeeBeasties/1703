During this timespan, the response rate has noticeably improved. The lowest return rate (17%) was obtained in 2010/2011 and the highest (27%) was collected in 2015/2016. The average number of responses was 829 per year (approximately 25%) for the time interval covered by this report. The distribution of students by credential and by college was roughly in line with the overall composition of the Ferris student body. Bachelor’s and graduate degree students were somewhat over-represented and those in certificate and Associates degree programs were under-represented. Student satisfaction on most Likert scale items was modest and consistent over time. The item with the poorest scores was “how often have you recommended Ferris/Kendall to others”. At this time, it is unclear why there is an apparent disconnect between student satisfaction and recommendation. Some suggestions are made for delving deeper into these results.

["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Each year, Ferris State University performs surveys to obtain information related to student satisfaction, job placement, and any further academic achievements of its graduates. Annual reports are generated and are available online. The goal of this report is to compare the data collected in the surveys given since our last HLC accreditation visit. Special attention is given to identify any strengths, weaknesses, or developing trends. These findings may be of some use as we begin to prepare for our next accreditation visit. "],

These files were used to create three separate working data files, which are stored in the data folder. These files are as follows: grad_survey_colleges.csv Year = academic year of survey College = two-letter abbreviation of the academic college responses = number of valid student responses grad_survey_degrees.csv Year = academic year of survey Degree = academic credential earned responses = number of valid student responses grad_survey_questions.csv year = academic year of survey item = the question number from the survey level0 = number of non-responses level1 = number of students selecting the lowest possible score level2 = number of students selecting the second lowest score level3 = number of students selecting the second highest score level4 = number of students selecting the highest score The actual numbers of graduates by college and by academic credential awarded were derived from information in the Ferris Factbooks. These resources are also available online. The numbers used in this report were taken from the 2012/2013 and 2016/2017 Factbooks. A pdf version of each of these is also available in the rawData folder. This information was used to prepare two more data files (each in the data folder): factbook_colleges.csv Year = academic year of survey College = two-letter abbreviation of the academic college responses = number of graduates in the college factbook_degrees.csv Year = academic year of survey Degree = academic credential earned responses = number of graduates earning the credential Finally, student satisfaction data from the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) were obtained. This subset of NSSE data can also be found in the data folder: NSSE_satisfaction.csv Year = Year that the NSSE was administered Class = Class standing (freshman or senior) Definitely No = Percent of students responding Probably No = Percent of students responding Probably Yes = Percent of students responding Definitely Yes = Percent of students responding Data provenance Data provenance refers to a system that permits tracking of the origin, movement, modification, and utilization of data sets (Buneman, Khanna, and Wang-Chiew 2001). The provenance of General Education data will be explicitly declared to facilitate the reproducibility and extensibility of these studies.

Responses to seven of the more quantitative questions (numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 21, 22, and 23) were also examined. In general, student satisfaction is fairly consistent, if perhaps a bit low. A more complete examination of each comparision is provided below. Response rate by year Student response rates for the graduation survey have generally been sufficient over the past six years to allow generalizations to be drawn for the entire population of Ferris graduates. Figure 1 shows the total number of alumni responses collected each academic year. The fewest responses, 524, were collected in 2010/2011 (17% response rate). There has been a steady improvement in response rate since that time. The overall average response rate was 829 per year for the interval investigated (approximately a 25% overall return rate). Samples of this size ought to give estimates with a margin or error between two and four percent. Figure 1: Total number of student survey responses per academic year Is a response rate of under 30% adequate? What should our target reponse rate be for this instrument? What can be done differently to increase our response rate further? Response rate by degree earned In order to reliably generalize the findings of these surveys, the demographics of the survey population should also be similar to that of the overall student body at Ferris State University. Therefore, the percent of respondants by credential earned were compared to the percent of actual credentials earned for each year under study, Figure 2 shows the actual distribution of credentials awarded by Ferris for each of the past six years. Figure 2: Distribution of credentials awarded by Ferris per academic year In comparison, Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of credentials earned by the survey respondants. It is readily apparent that Bachelors and Graduate (Masters, Doctoral, and Professional) degrees are over-represented in the survey population. On the other hand, Associates degrees and certificates are under-represented. This reporting bias should be kept in mind while interpreting the survey responses that follow.
