Over this timespan, the response rate has noticeably improved. The lowest return rate (17%) was obtained in 2010/2011 and the highest (27%) was collected in 2015/2016. The average number of responses was 829 per year for the time interval covered by this report. The distribution of students by credential and by college was roughly in line with the overall composition of the Ferris student body. Bachelor’s and graduate degree students were somewhat over-represented and those in certificate programs were under-represented. Student satisfaction on most Likert scale items was fairly high and stable over time. The item with the poorest scores was “how often have you recommended Ferris/Kendall to others”. At this time, it is unclear why there is an apparent disconnect between student satisfaction and recommendation. Report number 1703, DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/MRJBD↩ "],

The data file, ‘registrations.csv’, contains only the course name (e.g. BIOL 101), the core competency (e.g. Natural Sciences), and the standardized measure (e.g. Selected Response Exam). The datafile is available here. Data provenance Data provenance refers to a system that permits tracking of the origin, movement, modification, and utilization of data sets (Buneman, Khanna, and Wang-Chiew 2001). The provenance of General Education data will be explicitly declared to facilitate the reproducibility and extensibility of these studies.

Responses to seven of the more quantitative questions (numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 21, 22, and 23) were also examined. In general, student satisfaction is fairly constant or slightly improving. A more complete examination of each comparision is provided below. Response rate by year Student response rates for the graduation survey have generally been sufficient over the past six years to allow generalizations to be drawn for the entire population of Ferris graduates. Figure 1 shows the total number of alumni responses collected each academic year. The fewest responses, 524, were collected in 2010/2011 (17% response rate). There has been a steady improvement in response rate since that time. The overall average response rate was 829 per year for the interval investigated (approximately a 25% overall return rate). Figure 1: Total number of student survey responses per academic year Is a response rate of under 30% adequate? What should our target reponse rate be for this instrument? What can be done differently to increase our response rate further? Response rate by degree earned Here is the actual distribution of credentials awarded by Ferris for each of the past six years. Figure 2: Distribution of credentials awarded by Ferris per academic year Here is the response rate by degree. Figure 3: Percent of student survey responses by degree earned per academic year Do you think that there are too many exams in this mix? What is the desired balance between exams, products, and performances for General Education? Response rate by college Here is the distribution of graduates by academic college for the past six years. Figure 4: Distribution of graduates by academic college per academic year And here is the distribution of responses by college.
