Over this timespan, the number of student respondents has noticeably improved. The lowest return rate (17%) was obtained in 2010/2011 and the highest (27%) was collected in 2015/2016. The average number of responses was 826 per year for this interval. Report number 1703, DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/MRJBD↩ "],

["methods.html", "Methods Data collection Data provenance", " Methods Data collection All registration records for the fall of 2017 were collated and de-identified. The data file, ‘registrations.csv’, contains only the course name (e.g. BIOL 101), the core competency (e.g. Natural Sciences), and the standardized measure (e.g. Selected Response Exam). The datafile is available here. Data provenance Data provenance refers to a system that permits tracking of the origin, movement, modification, and utilization of data sets (Buneman, Khanna, and Wang-Chiew 2001). The provenance of General Education data will be explicitly declared to facilitate the reproducibility and extensibility of these studies. Location of public website files All files related to this report can be found online at the Open Science Framework (Nosek 2012). This site contains all of the files needed to reproduce this report from the de-identified data set. The site’s url is https://osf.io/t6u8m/. Session information This report was written using RStudio (RStudio Team 2015) and the R statistical programming language (R Core Team 2013). These products are free to download for PC, Macintosh, and Linux operating systems. The following information pertains to the session parameters used to generate this report. If you have trouble reproducing this report, it may be due to different session parameters. You may contact Dr. Franklund if you need assistance.
