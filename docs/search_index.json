During this timespan, the response rate has noticeably improved. The lowest return rate (17%) was obtained in 2010/2011 and the highest (27%) was collected in 2015/2016. The average number of responses was 829 per year (approximately 25%) for the time interval covered by this report. The distribution of students by credential and by college was roughly in line with the overall composition of the Ferris student body. Bachelor’s and graduate degree students were somewhat over-represented and those in certificate and Associates degree programs were under-represented. Student satisfaction on most Likert scale items was modest and consistent over time. The item with the poorest scores was “how often have you recommended Ferris/Kendall to others”. At this time, it is unclear why there is an apparent disconnect between student satisfaction and recommendation. Some thought questions are posed to stimulate discussion and lead to a deeper analysis of these graduate attitudes. Report number 1703, DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/YPCQD↩ "],
["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Each year, Ferris State University performs surveys to obtain information related to student satisfaction, job placement, and any further academic achievements of its graduates. Annual reports are generated and are available online. The goal of this report is to compare the data collected in the surveys given since our last HLC accreditation visit. Special attention is given to identify any strengths, weaknesses, or developing trends. These findings may be of some use as we begin to prepare for our next accreditation visit. "],

["results.html", "Results and Discussion Response rate by year Response rate by degree earned Response rate by college Overall satisfaction ratings Preparation for employment Preparation for continuing education Good value for the money Recommendation of Ferris/KCAD Would choose FSU/KCAD again Would choose the same program again", " Results and Discussion The response rates and their overall composition were compared for the six academic years under investigation. Responses to seven of the more quantitative questions (numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 21, 22, and 23) were also examined. In general, student satisfaction is fairly consistent, if perhaps a bit low. A more complete examination of each comparision is provided below. Response rate by year Student response rates for the graduation survey have generally been sufficient over the past six years to allow generalizations to be drawn for the entire population of Ferris graduates. Figure 1 shows the total number of alumni responses collected each academic year. The fewest responses, 524, were collected in 2010/2011 (17% response rate). There has been a steady improvement in response rate since that time. The overall average response rate was 829 per year for the interval investigated (approximately a 25% overall return rate). Samples of this size ought to give estimates with a margin or error between two and four percent. Figure 1: Total number of student survey responses per academic year Is a response rate of under 30% adequate? What should our target reponse rate be for this instrument? What can be done differently to increase our response rate further? Response rate by degree earned In order to reliably generalize the findings of these surveys, the demographics of the survey population should also be similar to that of the overall student body at Ferris State University. Therefore, the percent of respondants by credential earned were compared to the percent of actual credentials earned for each year under study, Figure 2 shows the actual distribution of credentials awarded by Ferris for each of the past six years. Figure 2: Distribution of credentials awarded by Ferris per academic year In comparison, Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of credentials earned by the survey respondants. It is readily apparent that Bachelors and Graduate (Masters, Doctoral, and Professional) degrees are over-represented in the survey population. On the other hand, Associates degrees and certificates are under-represented. This reporting bias should be kept in mind while interpreting the survey responses that follow. Figure 3: Percent of student survey responses by degree earned per academic year Do you think that the bias for Bachelor and Graduate degrees is problematic? What steps can we take to ensure better reporting from students in Associates degrees and certificate programs? Response rate by college Another potential bias could be in the balance of students from various academic colleges. If one or more colleges predominate the survey population, they could skew the results and make interpretation more difficult. The actual distribution of graduates by academic college are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4: Distribution of graduates by academic college per academic year Figure 5, in contrast, demonstrates the distribution of survey respondants by academic college. The first thing that is apparent is that Kendall College of Art and Design (KCAD) was not included in the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 datasets. The colleges of Business and Health Professions are slightly over-represented. KCAD, on the other hand, remains somewhat under-represented. The overall proportions are reasonably similar and stable over time. Given these facts, the last four years of data are probably representative enough to make some valid generalizations. Figure 5: Percent of student survey responses by academic college per academic year Do you think that any effort needs to be made to get more representative sampling? Overall satisfaction ratings The overall satisfaction of survey respondants was obtained by from item 1 of the survey: I am satisfied with the quality of education that I recieved at Ferris State University/Kendall College of Art and Design. The mean number of positive responses over the past four years was 92.55%. The trends for responses to this item are shown in Figure 6. The ratio of respondants that “strongly agree” to “somewhat agree” was 1.62:1. These results seem to represent a fairly high level of overall satisfaction among our responding graduates. Figure 6: I am satisfied with the quality of education that I received at FSU/KCAD. Do you think that this level of overall satisfaction is sufficient? Or, is there a need to substantially increase this level? Preparation for employment Item two on the survey was Ferris State University/Kendall College of Art and Design prepared me well for employment. The graduate responses are illustrated in Figure 7. For this item, the ratio of respondants that “strongly agree” to “somewhat agree” was 1.07:1. The overall number of positive responses over the past four years was 86.08%. These results are somewhat lower than those for item one, but are fairly stable over time. Figure 7: FSU/KCAD prepared me well for employment. One out of seven graduates did not feel that FSU/KCAD prepared them well for employment. Is this a problem? What can we do to learn more about these unsatisfied graduates? Preparation for continuing education The third item of the survey was Ferris State University/Kendall College of Art and Design prepared me well for continuing my education. The graduate responses are illustrated in Figure 8. For this item, the ratio of respondants that “strongly agree” to “somewhat agree” was 1.04:1. The overall number of positive responses over the past four years was 86.8%. These results are nearly the same as those of item two. Given that Graduate and Bachelors degree recipients are over-represented in our sample, these numbers are perhaps a bit low. Figure 8: FSU/KCAD prepared me well for continuing my education. One out of seven graduates were not satisfied with their preparation for their continuing education. How can we identify any issues or problems so that they can be addressed? Good value for the money The cost of higher education has continued to increase over the past decade. It is interesting to see if this increase has impacted students’ perceptions regarding the value that they get for their money. Item four on the survey was Ferris State University/Kendall College of Art and Design was a good value for my money. The graduate responses are illustrated in Figure 9. For this item, the ratio of respondants that “strongly agree” to “somewhat agree” was 0.93:1. The overall number of positive responses over the past four years was 80.12%. Figure 9: FSU/KCAD was a good value for my money. One out of five graduates does not feel that they got a good value for their money from FSU/Kendall. While it is not surprising that this value is lower, what can we do to increase the value that students perceive from their education at FSU/KCAD? Recommendation of Ferris/KCAD Our graduates are probably the best advertisement that we have for our institution. Item twenty-one addresses this and it phrase as Since graduating, how often have you recommended FSU/KCAD to prospective students? The graduate responses are illustrated in Figure 10. For this item, the ratio of respondants that recommended Ferris “often” to “a few times” was only 0.55:1. The overall number of positive responses over the past four years was 50.05%. This is by far the lowest score for all the items on the survey. Figure 10: Since graduating, how often have you recommended FSU/KCAD to prospective students? Only half of all respondants indicated that they recommended FSU/KCAD to others very often. What do you think accounts for the apparent discrepancy between satisfaction and recommendation? What can we do to encourage our graduates to recommend FSU/KCAD more in the future? Would choose FSU/KCAD again Item twenty-two also indicates satisfaction with Ferris State University and/or Kendall College of Art and Design overall. It was worded as If I had the opportunity to start college over, I would still choose to attend Ferris State University/Kendall College of Art and Design. The graduate responses are illustrated in Figure 11. For this item, the ratio of respondants that “strongly agree” to “somewhat agree” was 1.41:1. The overall number of positive responses over the past four years was 79.6%. Figure 11: If I had the opportunity to start college over, I would still choose to attend FSU/KCAD. A very similar item also appears in the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). It was worded as If you could start over again, would you go to the same institution you are now attending? The responses for freshmen and seniors taking the NSSE are illustrated in Figure 12. These NSSE scores are similar to those of the graduate surveys, but seem to have a more negative trend over time. Figure 12: If you could start over again, would you go to the same institution you are now attending? One out of five graduates state that they would not attend FSU/KCAD if they had it all to do over again. The NSSE results are even a bit worse. How can we identify and address the factors that contribute to this dissatisfaction? Would choose the same program again Many students come to Ferris specifically for a particular program. As a result, these students often have more affinity for their program than they do to the overall institution. The last item evaluated (item twenty-three) addresses this as If I had the opportunity to start college over, I would still choose the same program of study. The graduate responses are illustrated in Figure 11. For this item, the ratio of respondants that “strongly agree” to “somewhat agree” was 2.11:1. The overall number of positive responses over the past four years was 77.88%. The overall score for programs is actually lower than for the entire instituation (by a little). The ratio of “strongly agree” to “somewhat agree”, though, is much higher. Figure 13: If I had the opportunity to start college over, I would still choose the same program of study. Despite our strong academic programs, one out of five graduates would not consider choosing their program again. What can we do to identify the causes of this dissatisfaction? There is most likely a correlation between items 22 and 23. Do you think that one impacts the other? If so, in which direction does that causal link fall? "],
["epilogue.html", "Epilogue", " Epilogue Based upon the discussions to date, here are some observations, interpretations, and suggested future actions. March 14, 2018: The consensus of opinion thus far is that the results are suggestive, but not all that helpful for making rational decision making. I tend to agree. This report was constructed using aggregated data. Therefore, it is not possible to merge in other variables that could be helpful (like demographic data). It may be possible to obtain the raw data as SPSS .sav files. These data would have student ID numbers and allow a deeper look at the patterns seen here. This may be the single best option for a future action at this time. Any other thoughts? "]
